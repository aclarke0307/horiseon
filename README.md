# The Horiseon Project

## Purpose

The Horiseon marketing agency had assigned me the task of making their code more accessible. When first reviewing the code there was lack of HTML5 structure. The Orginal code had mainly Div tags, not that it was an issue but, to be more organized and make it easier for myself and other developers to look at the code I added other elements. I added Header, Nav, Section, Article, and Footer Tags. I also added hidden comments to be even clear where certain parts started and ended. For exmaple, in the sixth screenshot You can see where I started and ended the Nav element. The hidden comments just help to locate certain sections faster if we ever need to revist the code. 

When reviewing the application on a browser I first noticed that one of the headers "search emgine optimization" sections was not navigating to the associated section of the page. This was an issue becuase the other two headers where working. To fix this mistake I added an ID attribute that corresponded to the Href in in the Nav section. The first screenshot is the orginal code the second screenshot is the ID I added.

Another issue I found was looking over the code was the use of an unnecessary class. At the end of the code there was a Div tag with a class called Footer as seen in the third screenshot. To improve this, I removed the Div and replaced it with the Footer element, as seen in the fourth screenshot. The fifth screenshot, I just removed the period  in the style sheet because there was no longer a class.  

There was repetitive CSS style in the seventh screenshot you will see the same code all under the H2 to fix this i just removed the period to remove the class factor and just left it as h2. In the eighth screenshot is it shortened, it will not affect the page because the all the h2 before had the same property and value. 

Another repetitve CSS that I found was in the ninth Screenshot, it was a bit more diffcult to shorten because there was not a common element. So I decide to add a class called "mini"; as seen in the tenth screenshot. From there I was able to shorten the CSS, as seen in the eleventh screenshot. 

Overall, this code refractor was good prcatice in understanding how to orginazed a code and practicing how to look over it to fix a problem. This help me better under stand how Class and Id attribute work and how they can affect the CSS. I believe I cleaned up the index sheet and the CSS sheet to make it more accesible to other developers and the Horiseon marketing agency.
